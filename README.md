FFF/FDM 3D Print Keycap.

# Stem Image
Especially regarding the stem part, it is designed to optimize the movement of the tool head for FDM 3D printers.

# Setting
## Printer and Slicer
My environment: VORON 2.4 R2 350mm with 0.4mm nozzle (Phaetus Dragon HF).
Below are settings in PrusaSlicer for reference. There may more accurate and faster print settings.

**To avoid choppy nozzle path, set Perimeter Generator to Classic. If arachne is selected the path will be messy!**

Sliced image, especially stem, should be like this. If the nozzle path is choppy, adjust the settings.

## Material
ABS or PLA is easier to print. PETG lacks shaft durability and is prone to clumping, so it is not recommended. When ironing, PLA is the best.
